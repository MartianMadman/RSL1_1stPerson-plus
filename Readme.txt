Addon mod for Red Faction Guerrilla Re-mars-tered that attempts to improve RSL1 1st Person by changing a ton of player animations to reduce player model clipping and also adds other useful options like adjustable vehicle fov. Remember that this mod itself is not a 1st Person mod.

\Install from github/
This mod is made to work with RFG Mod Manager Re-mars-tered only and doesn't need to be packed by the developer to work. To install from github you'll first obviously need to download the repository files. Then download the Mod Manager for RFG which can be found at (https://www.factionfiles.com/ff.php?action=search&pageaction=searchfiles&search_query=mod+manager&file_searchby=7&file_searchgame=3&file_searchcat=&file_sort=5) Use the readme in the Mod Manager download to read up on how to use it. Only the Mod Manager for the original RFG has the readme which is a bit inconvenient. Once done with that, copy the source directory of the 1stPerson-plus mod into the mods folder of Mod Manager. Optionally you should rename the directory you copied to 1stPerson-plus after you've put it in the mods folder. At this point you should be good to go and Mod Manager should be able to install it from here.

\What is RSL1?/
RSL1 is a script loader for the remastered version of RFG. It is similar to the famous scripthook and native trainers of gta 4 and 5. RSL1 can be found at (https://github.com/rsl-dev/RSL)

\Tips for RSL1 1st Person/
The 1st Person on RSL1 is framerate based. How it works is that the position of the camera updates every frame and higher rates will have significantly less model clipping. Turning vsync off and leaving the framerate uncapped is recommended.
